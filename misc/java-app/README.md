Logicpro.se
===========

A peer-network community forum for, musicians and professionals using the digital audio workstation software Logic by Apple.

## Giving back to the users

### Where we come from

The forum was initially a hosted PHP-based server-client solution. It always had a very small user-base. As an effort to free the aggregated information in the hosted database, a renewal project was started.

### Where we're heading

The goal of this project is to allow the users to download all the aggregated data in the forum database, and to provide self-hosting. Each user may then take part in a P2P-network, and continue to interact in the forum but through a local running hosted application. Any new data will be distributed in a mesh-network, providing everyone with their own personal copy of the information.
